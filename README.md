# Crystal Collector
## What is this game about?
Crystal Collector is a clicking game that built with jQuery and JavaScript. Each time the player needs to guess add up the four crystals' value(hidden numbers) to get the right number in the red area. Once the player doesn't get the right one, computer is going to run another random number.


## How to play?
- First the computer is going to generate a random number that the player needs to guess. For example: **Number to guess: 89**
- The player will click on each crystals to get the hidden number. **Green** is 1, **Blue** is 19, **Red** is 8, **White** is 11.
- Each time, the numbers will add up, which the player is going to have a **Total score** by clicking each crystals. 
- Once the **Total score** equals to the **Number to guess: 89**, **wins** adds one point. Otherwise, **Losses** adds one point, the computer generates another random number at the same time.
